                        <p>
                            Ridge blocks are specialized concrete blocks designed to finish the top of a wall, 
                            especially where the roof meets the wall at the ridge (the highest point). 
                            These blocks are shaped to fit neatly along the sloping edges of pitched roofs, providing a smooth
                             surface for roofing materials like tiles, iron sheets, or thatch to rest upon.

                        <p>
                            Quarry tiles are hard, dense, and durable tiles made from natural clay or shale. 
                            They are fired at high temperatures which makes them strong, water-resistant, and perfect for both indoor and outdoor use.
                            They usually have a reddish-brown or earthy tone but can also come in other natural colors 
                            depending on the minerals in the clay. Quarry tiles have a non-porous surface and offer excellent resistance to wear.

                        <p>
                            Portuguese blocks are small, square or rectangular stones typically made from granite, basalt, or limestone. 
                            They are commonly used for paving streets, sidewalks, driveways, and courtyards.
                            Portuguese blocks are especially popular in European-style architecture and are known for creating beautiful, 
                            artistic pavements  you’ll often see them in historical town centers, plazas, and old cities.

                            Mangalore tiles are a popular traditional roofing material, especially for homes, schools, churches, and older institutional buildings.
                             These tiles are made from baked clay, giving them their signature reddish-brown or terracotta color.

                        <p>
                            Marseille tiles are flat, interlocking clay roofing tiles that are widely used in Uganda for both residential and institutional buildings. 
                            Originally designed in Marseille, France, these tiles became popular in 
                            Uganda during the colonial period and are still used today because of their reliability and neat appearance.

                        <p>
                            Facing bricks are specially designed bricks used on the external surfaces of buildings to provide an attractive 
                            appearance along with strength and durability. Unlike ordinary bricks used for internal or hidden construction, 
                            facing bricks are made to be visible and are available in a wide variety of colors, textures, and finishes. 
                            They are engineered to resist weather, moisture, and general wear, helping maintain the building’s look over time.
